# üéº Brinf Music Journal

A personal blog generator that transforms your Last.fm listening history into unique, AI-generated creative posts. This project connects to your scrobbles, selects a song, and leverages the power of the Google Gemini AI to write an evocative text inspired by the song's title.

*(A future screenshot of the project will be placed here once the UI is developed)*
