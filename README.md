# üéº Brinf Music Journal

A personal blog generator that transforms your Last.fm listening history into unique, AI-generated creative posts. This project connects to your scrobbles, selects a song, and leverages the power of the Google Gemini AI to write an evocative text inspired by the song's title.

*(A future screenshot of the project will be placed here once the UI is developed)*

## üöÄ Getting Started & Local Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brinf-music-journal.git
cd brinf-music-journal
```

**2. Install dependencies:**  
This project uses npm as the package manager.
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Set up environment variables:**  
Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project. You can do this by duplicating the `.env.example` file if one exists. This file will hold your secret API keys.

```bash
# .env.local

# Key obtained from Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"

# Key obtained from Last.fm (https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)
LASTFM_API_KEY="YOUR_LASTFM_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**4. Run the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

- [ ] Implement pagination to navigate through the entire Last.fm scrobble history.  
- [ ] Add social sharing buttons for the "sound postcards".
